# Active voice
- **12 tenses** = 3 **tenses** (*Present*, *Past*, *Future*) * 4 **aspects** (*Simple*, *Continuous*, *Perfect*, *Perfect Continuous*)
- **16 tenses** = 12 **tenses** + **Future in the Past**

<br>

## Notation
- **V1** is a **bare infinitive** of the **main verb**.
- **ING** is the **main verb** with `-ing` suffix.
- **V2** is a **past form** of the **main verb**.
- **V3** is a **past participle** [/ˌpɑːst pɑː ˈtɪs.ɪ.pəl/] (`pp`) of the **main verb**.
- **S** is a contraction for **Subject**.
- **O** is a contraction for **Object**.

<br>

## Clause types
- `+` **Affirmative** /əˈfɜːrmətɪv/ (aka **statement**)
- `-` **Negative** /ˈneɡətɪv/
- `?` **Interrogative** /ˌɪntəˈrɑːɡətɪv/
- `?` **Negative interrogative**

<br>

## Subject-verb agreement
The **person** and **number** of the **subject** of the *clause* determine the **person** and **number** of the **verb** of the *clause*. This is called **subject–verb agreement** or **concord**.<br>
In other words,
- the **auxiliary** verb *must* **agree** in **person** and **number** with the **subject**;
- if there is **no** *auxiliary* verb then **main** verb *must* **agree** in **person** and **number** with the **subject**;

<br>

### To have
- In all clause types (**affirmative**, **interrogative** and **negative**) we use **auxiliary verbs**:
  - `have`/`haven't` with the **first/second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `has`/`hasn't` with the **third person singular**;

<br>

### To be
- In all clause types (the **affirmative**, **interrogative** and **negative**) we use **auxiliary verbs**:
  - `am`/`am not` with the **first person**;
  - `are`/`are not` with the **second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `is`/`isn't` with the **third person singular**;

<br>

### To do
- In the **interrogative** and **negative** we use **auxiliary verbs**:
  - `do`/`don't` with the **first/second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `does`/`doesn't` with the **third person singular**;

<br>

## Adverbs of frequency
**Adverbs of frequency** show how often something happen.<br>

1. *Adverbs of frequency* go **before** the **main verb** if there is **no** auxiliary:
- I `usually` **work** on Saturdays.
- They `never` **drink** coffee.
2. *Adverbs of frequency* go **after** the **verb** `to be` if there is **no** auxiliary:
- It **is** `often` cold in winter.
- He **is** `always` late for work.
3. In all other cases *adverbs of frequency* go **after auxiliary verbs** (`can`, `do`, etc):
- He **can** `never` **wake** up before 10 o'clock.
- **Do** they `often` **go** to the cinema?
- We **don't** `often` **play** football.

- They `often` **go** to the gym.
- `Do` they `often` **go** to the gym?
