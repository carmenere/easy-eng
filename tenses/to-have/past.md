1. The **past simple** of verb `have` is `had`. It is the same **in** all persons.
2. We form **questions** with the **auxiliary** verb `did`, the `subject` and the verb `have`.
   - `Did` you **have** many toys when **you** `were` child?
3. We form **negations** with `did not`/`didn't` + `have`.
   - I `didn't` **have** many toys when **I** `was` child.
