# Notations
## Common
- `V1` is a **bare infinitive** of the **main verb**.
- `ing` is the **main verb** with `-ing` suffix.

<br>

## Clause types
- `+` **Affirmative** /əˈfɜːrmətɪv/ (aka **statement**)
- `-` **Negative** /ˈneɡətɪv/
- `?` **Interrogative** /ˌɪntəˈrɑːɡətɪv/
- `?-` **Negative interrogative**, there are 2 ways to form **negative interrogative** sentences:
  - put **not** **after** the **subject**;
  - use the **contraction** of the verb in the **beginning**;

<br>

# Subject-verb agreement
The **person** and **number** of the **subject** of the *clause* determine the **person** and **number** of the **verb** of the *clause*. This is called **subject–verb agreement** or **concord**.<br>
In other words,
- the **auxiliary** verb *must* **agree** in **person** and **number** with the **subject**;
- if there is **no** *auxiliary* verb then **main** verb *must* **agree** in **person** and **number** with the **subject**;

<br>

## To have
### Present
- In **all** clause types (**affirmative**, **interrogative** and **negative**) we use:
  - `have`/`haven't` with the **first/second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `has`/`hasn't` with the **third person singular**;

<br>

## To be
### Present
- In **all** clause types (the **affirmative**, **interrogative** and **negative**) we use:
  - `am`/`am not` with the **first person**;
  - `are`/`are not` with the **second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `is`/`isn't` with the **third person singular**;

### Past

- In the **interrogative** and **negative** we use:
  - `do`/`don't` with the **first/second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `does`/`doesn't` with the **third person singular**;

<br>

# Active voice
**4 aspects**:<br>
1. **Simple**: `V1`
2. **Continuous**: `to be` + `ing`
3. **Perfect**: `to have` + `V3`
4. **Perfect Continuous**: `to have` + `been` + `ing`

**4 tenses**:<br>
1. **Past**
2. **Present**
3. **Future**
4. **Future in the Past**

<br>

So, there are:<br>
- **16 tenses** = 4 **tenses** (*Present*, *Past*, *Future*, *Future in the Past*) * 4 **aspects** (*Simple*, *Continuous*, *Perfect*, *Perfect Continuous*)

<br>

## Simple
**Formula**: `V1`<br>

<br>

> **Notes**:<br>
> We **add** an `-s` to the **main** verb when **subject** is **third person singular** (**affirmative** case).<br>
> **But** we **don't add** an `-s` to the **main** verb when it appears with `does`/`doesn't` (**interrogative** and **negative** cases).<br>
> We use `V2` as the **main** verb in **affirmative**.<br>
> **But** we use a `V1` as the **main** verb when it appears with `did`/`didn't` (**interrogative** and **negative** cases).<br>
