# Be going to
We use `to be` + `going to` + `bare infinitive`:
1. For plans and intentions for near future:
  - She `is` `going to` **eat** out tonight.
  - I'`m` `going to` **buy** a ball in the evening.
  - He'`s` `going to` **read** that book this summer.
2. When there is evidence that something is going to happen in the near future:
   - It `is` `going to` **rain**. There are dark clouds in the sky. (visible evidence)
3. We form **question** by putting `to be` **before** the `subject`:
   - `Is` he `going to` **eat** out tonight?
4. We form **negations** by putting `not` **after** `to be`:
   - He `isn't` `going to` eat out tonight.
