1. The **past simple** of verb `to be` is
- `was` for **I**, **he**, **she**, **it**;
- `were` for **we**, **you**, **they**;
2. We form **question** by putting `was`/`were` before the subject pronoun.
   - **She** `was` *ill* yesterday → `Was` she *ill* yesterday?
   - **They** `were` fine yesterday.
3. We form **negations** by putting not after `was`/`were`.
   - She `was` **not** *ill* yesterday → She `wasn't` *ill* yesterday.
   - **They** `were` **not** fine yesterday. → **They** `weren't` **not** fine yesterday.
