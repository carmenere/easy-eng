# Types
- The **zero conditional** (aka **type 0 conditional**) describes **facts**.
- The **first conditional** (aka **type 1 conditional**) describes things that are **likely** to happen in the future.
- The **second conditional** (aka **type 2 conditional**) is used to imagine **present** or **future** situations that are **unlikely** in reality.
- The **third conditional** (aka **type 3 conditional**) is used to describe a situation that **didn't happen** but we want to **imagine** their possible **result**.
