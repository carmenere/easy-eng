# Wishes
1. We use `wish`/`if only` + `past simple` for the present:
   - I `wish` I **had** a lot of money. (But I `don't` **have** a lot of money.)
   - `If only` I **had** a lot of money. (But I `don't` **have** a lot of money.)
   - I `wish` I **didn't have** to walk to work.
   - I `wish` I **didn't have** a temperature.
2. We use `wish`/`if only` + `past perfect` to express regret that something happened or didn't happen in the **past**:
   - I `wish` I `had` **come** to your pasty last night. (But I `didn't` **come** to your party.)
   - `If only` I `had` **listened** to your advice. (But I `didn't` **listen** to your advice.)
   - I `wish` it `hadn't` **rained** every day.
