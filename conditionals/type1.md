**Type 1 conditionals** express a **real** or **very probable** situation in the **present** or **future**.

<br>

**Type 1 conditionals** are formed as follows:<br>
|If clause /klɔːz/|Main clause|
|:--------------------|:--------------|
|`If` + `present simple`|`future simple`|
|`If` + `present simple`|`present simple`|
|`If` + `present simple`|`imperative`|
|`If` + `present simple`|`modal verb` + `bare infinitive`|

<br>

If there is **negation** in **if clause**, we can change `if` to `unless` and drop **not**:
- `If` you `don't` **hurry** up, we'`ll` **be late** for school.
- `Unless` you **hurry**, we'`ll` **be late** for school.
