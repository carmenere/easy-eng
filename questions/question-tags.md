# Question tags
**Question tags** are **short questions** at the end of statement.<br>
We use them when we want to confirm something or when we want to find out if something is true or not.<br>

<br>

## Rules
1. When the statement is **positive**, the question tag is **negative**:
   - She `was` at home, `wasn't` **she**?
   - He `lives` in a flat, `doesn't` **he**?
   - There `is` a man in the boat, `isn't` **there**?
   - That's John's coat, `isn't` **it**?
2. When the statement is **negative**, the question tag is **positive**:
   - They `haven't` finenished yet, `have` **they**?
   - She `won't` come to the party, `will` **she**?
   - She `isn't` married, `is` **she**?
3. When sentence contains word with negative meaning like `never`, `hardly`, `seldom` or `rarely`, the question tag is **positive**:
   - He works `hardly`, `is` **he**?
   - He is `never` late, `is` **he**?
   - They `seldom` go to the theatre, `do` **they**?
