# Questions with Yes/No answers
These kinds of question begin with an **auxiliary verb** (`am`/`is`/`are`, `have`/`has`, `do`/`does`, `did`, `will`, `can`) followed by **subject**.<br>
We usually answer these questions with Yes/No answers: 
- `Yes`, `subject` + `auxiliary verb`;
- `No`, `subject` + `auxiliary verb` + **not**;
