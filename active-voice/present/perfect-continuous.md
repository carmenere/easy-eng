# Usage
The **present perfect continuous** is used:
- to put **emphasis** /ˈemfəsɪs/ on the **duration** of an action:
  - She `has` `been` paint`ing` this picture **for 2 hours**.
  - **But**:
    - He `has` paint`ed` **twenty pictures**. (Here we use **present perfect simple** to put **emphasis** on **number**.)
- for **actions** which **started in the past** and are **still continuing in the present**:
  - He `has` `been` teach`ing` for 6 years.

# Formation and verb agreement
1. We form the **present perfect continuous** with the `have`/`has` + `been` + `ing form`.
   - He `has` `been` read`ing` this newspaper **for an hour**.
2. We form **question** by putting `have`/`has` **before** the `subject`:
   - `Have` you `been` liv`ing` here long?
3. We form **negations** by putting `not` **after** `have`/`has`:
   - They `haven't` `been` wait`ing` for a long time.
   - She `hasn't` `been` work`ing` here long.
