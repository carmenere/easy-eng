# Formation and verb agreement
We form the **present simple** with the **subject** and **main** verb:
- in the *affirmative*
  - we **add** an `-s` to the **main** verb when **subject** is **third person singular**;
- in the *interrogative* and *negative* we use **auxiliary verbs**:
  - `do`/`don't` with the **first/second person** or **third person plural**;
  - `does`/`doesn't` with the **third person singular**:
    - we **don't** **add** an `-s` to the **main** verb when it appears with `does`/`doesn't`.<br>

<br>

**don't** /doʊnt/<br>
**doesn't** /dʌzənt/
