# Formation and verb agreement
1. We form the **past perfect continuous** with the `had` + `been` + `ing form`.
   - He `had` `been` read`ing` this newspaper **for an hour**.
2. We form **question** by putting `had` **before** the `subject`:
   - `Had` Peter `been` driv`ing` **for** two hours **before** he **had** the accident?
3. We form **negations** by putting `not` **after** `had`:
   - He `hadn't` `been` driv`ing` **for** two hours **before** he **had** the accident.
