# Usage
The **past simple** is used:
- for actions which happened at a **definite** time in the past, that is, **we know when it happened**:
  - They `got married` 15 years **ago**. (When did they married? 15 years ago)
- for **repeated actions** which happened in the past **but don't happend any more**. In this case we can use adverbs of frequency:
  - My father often `took` me to the playground when **I** `was` little.
- for **actions** which **happened immediately one after the other** in the past:
  - First, they `had` lunch. Then, they `met` thier friends.

# Formation and verb agreement
1. We form the **past simple** by adding `-ed` to the **main verb**.
   - He play**ed** football yesterday.
2. **Irregular** verbs don't form the past simple by adding `-ed`.
3. We form **question** with the **auxiliary** verb `did`, the `subject` and `bare infinitive`:
   - `Did` he **play** football yesterday?
4. We form **negations** with `did not`/`didn't` + `bare infinitive`.
   - He `didn't` **play** footbal yesterday.

<br>

**didn't** /dɪdənt/

# Spelling rules (for **third person singular**)
1. Most verbs form **past simple** by adding `-ed`:
   -clean → clean`ed`
2. Verbs ending in `-e` take only `-d`.
   - lik**e** → lik**e**`d`
3. Verbs ending in `consonant` + `y` drop `y` and take `-ied`:
   - stu**dy** → stu**d**`ied`
4. Verbs ending in `vowel` + `y` take `-ed`:
   - pla**y** → pla**y**`ed`
   - sta**y** → sta**y**`ed`
5. Verbs ending in one stressed vowel between 2 consonant **double** the **last consonant** and take `-ed`:
   - sto**p** → sto**pp**`ed`
   - **But**:
     - visi**t** → visi**t**`ed`
6. Verbs ending in **one** `l` **double** the `l` and take `ed`:
   - trave**l** → trave**ll**`ed`
   - quarre**l** → quarre**ll**`ed`
