# Possessives
**Possessives** are **all forms** of **possessive case**: nouns, adjectives, pronouns.

<br>

# Usage
We use the **possessive case**
- to show that **something belongs to somebody** e.g. `Tom's` car is very old;
- to explain the **relationship** between two or more people e.g. She is `Tom's` wife;

<br>

# Rules
1. The possessive case is formed in **two** ways:
   - with `'s` for **people** and **animals** e.g. The cat`'s` tail. John`'s` flat.
   - with the preposition `of` for **things** e.g. The legs `of` the table.
2. **Singular** nouns (and **proper** nouns too) take `'s`:
   - We are having a party at John`'s` house;
   - Kate drove his friend`'s` car;
3. The **plural** *regular* nouns ending in `-s` take only `'` (apostrophe /əˈpɑːstrəfi/):
   - This is my parents`'` house;
   - Those are ladies`'` shoes;
4. *Irregular* **plural** nouns take `'s`:
   - These are men`'s` shoes;
   - Children`'s` clothes are very expensive;
5. When the **same thing** belongs to **two** or **more** people we add `'s` only to the **last noun**:
   - This is Mike and Kate`'s` house. (The house belongs to both of them.)
   - This is Mary and Tony`'s` dog.
6. When **two** or **more** things belong to **two** or **more** people and we want to show that **each person has his/her own thing** we add `'s` to each noun:
   - These are Jill`'s` and Bob`'s` bicycles. Jill`'s` bicylce is red. Bob`'s` bicycle is blue.
   - Agata`'s` and Victoria`'s` roller skates (Each girl has her own roller skate).

> **Note**:<br>
> Tony's got = Tony has got<br>
> He's a = He is a<br>
> Tony's book = possessive case

<br>

# Pronunciation
The **pronunciations rules** for the **possessive case** are **the same** as the rules for **plural nouns**.

<br>

# Questions
When we want to know **to whom something belongs** we use the question word `whose`.
- Whose cat is that? It's Helen`'s`.

**Possessive adjectives** are put **before** nouns.<br>

- This is `my` bag. This bag is `mine`.
- That is `their` car. That car is `theirs`.
