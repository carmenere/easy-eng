# Infinitive
The **infinitive** is **the root form of the verb**.<br>
There are **two** kinds of infinitive: **to infinitive** and **bare infinitive**:

<br>

# to infinitive
We use **to infinitive**
1. after verbs such as: `want`, `ask`, `agree`, `help`, `hope`, `tell`, `decide`, `manage`, `offer`, `invite`, `promise`, `try`:
   - I `want` **to see** a film tonight.
   - I `want` **to go** now.
2. After the words `too` and `enough`:
   - He is `too` young `to drive` a car.
   - He isn't old `enough` `to drive` a car.
3. To **express purpose**, that is, the **reason** why someone does something:
   - He is going to bank **to get** some money.
4. After some verbs (`know`, `decide`, etc.) when there is question word (`who`, `what`, `where`, `how`, etc.):
   - I don't `know` `what` **to do**.

# bare infinitive
We use **bare infinitive** 
1. **after** modal verbs:
   - He `can't` read.
   - You must `go` now.
2. after the verbs `let` and `make`:
   - My parents don't `let` me **stay** out late.

      - He was `too` **late** `to catch` the bus. (= He was **so late** that he **didn't catch** the bus.)
      - She is `too` **young** `to go` out alone.
2. `Enough` has **positive** implication and it shows that something is as it's **expected**/**wanted**.
   1. `enough` + `noun` always followed by `to infinitive`:
      - We've got `enough` **money** `to eat` out. (= We can eat out.)
   2. `adjective/adverb` + `enough` always followed by `to infinitive`:
