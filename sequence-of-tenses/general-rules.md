# Sequence of tenses
## General rules
There are 2 genereal rules
1. If `Main` clause uses **Present** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then **any** appropriate *tense* can be used in `Subordinate` clause.
2. If `Main` clause uses **Future** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then **any** appropriate *tense* can be used in `Subordinate` clause.
3. If `Main` clause uses **Past** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then one of **Past** *tense* must be used.
   - **There 3 situations**:
     - action in `Main` clause and action in `Subordinate` clause are happening **simultaneously**:
       - They **told** us they **were going** to the library.
     - action in `Main` clause happened **before** action in `Subordinate` clause:
       - I **was sure** that Maria **had been hiding** the truth from all of us for a very long time.
     - action in `Subordinate` clause will happen **after** action in `Main` clause:
       - I kinda **knew** that you **would come** to me tonight!
       - You **said** you **would help** me with my French homework.

## Exceptions
- When we talk about facts:
  - Newton **proved** that bodies **attract** each other.
- **But** if `Main` clause uses **Future** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) and `Subordinate` **clause** is `Time` **clause**, i.e. starts with `if`/`when`/`till`/.., then **Present** `Simple` only must be used:
  - `If` the weather **is fine** tomorrow, we **will go** to the country.
  - `When` she **comes** to scholl she **will take off** her coat.
  - `When` you **cross** the park, you **will** see the hospital.
- **But** if `When` is a **question word**, then **sequnces of times rules** are **not** enforced:
  - Could you tell me **when the bus will come**?
