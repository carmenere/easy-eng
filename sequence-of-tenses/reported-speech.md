# Reported speech
**Reported speech** is how we represent the speech of other people. There are two main types of reported speech:
- **direct speech**: _direct speech_ repeats the exact words the person used, we use quotes `'` or `"`;
- **indirect speech**: in _indirect speech_, the original speaker’s words are changed;

<br>

_Reported speech_ consist of two parts: **reporting clause** + **reported clause**.<br>
The _reporting clause_ includes a verb such as **say**, **tell**, **ask**, **reply**, **shout**, usually in the past simple.<br>
The _reported clause_ includes what the original speaker said.<br>
