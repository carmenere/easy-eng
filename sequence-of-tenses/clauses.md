# Clause
A **clause** is a group of words which contains a **subject** and a **predicate** (**verb**) and expresses a complete thought. In other words, a **clause** is a **sentence** or a **part of a sentence** that has meaning **on its own**.<br>

There are **2** main types of clauses:
- **independent** clauses (aka **main** clause);
- **dependent** clauses (aka **subordinate** clause);

<br>

Kinds of **dependent** clauses:
- **relative** clauses;
- **time** clauses;

<br>

# Independent clause
An **independent** clause **can** *stand alone* as a **sentence**.<br>

### Examples
- She ran to catch the bus.
- He sings in the shower.
- The sun is shining brightly.
- They are going on vacation next week.
- I am learning to play the guitar.

<br>

# Dependent clause
A **dependent** clause **cannot** *stand alone* as a **sentence** and is dependent on an **independent** clause (aka **main** clause) to make sense.<br>

### Examples
- Because I was tired, I went to bed early.
- When she arrived at the party, everyone cheered.
- If it rains tomorrow, we will stay inside.
- Although he tried his best, he still failed the exam.
- Since I don't have a car, I take the bus to work.

<br>

# Relative clause
A **relative** clause is a **kind** of **dependent** clause which **provides additional information** about a **noun** or **pronoun** in your **main** clause.<br>
Relative clauses are introduced by relative pronouns such as `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which` and `that`.<br>

### Examples
- The man, **who lives in that house**, is a doctor.
- The book, **which I read last week**, was very interesting.
- The house, **whose roof was damaged**, is being repaired.
- The car, **that I bought last year**, broke down.
- The cake, **which my mom baked**, tasted delicious.

<br>

# Time clause
A **time** clause is a **dependent** clause that begins with a **time word**:
- `after`;
- `as long as`;
- `as soon as`;
- `as`;
- `before`;
- `by the time`;
- `hardly ... when ...`;
- `if`;
- `just as`;
- `once`;
- `since`;
- `till`;
- `untill`;
- `when`;
- `while`;

<br>

**Time clauses** follow **sequnces of times rules**. But if `when` is a **question word**, then **sequnces of times rules** are **not** enforced:
- Could you tell me **when the bus will come**?

<br>

## Sequence of tenses
|`Main` clause|`Time` clause|
|:--------------|:--------------|
|**Present** `Simple`|**Present** `Simple`|

|**Past** `Simple`|**Past** `Simple`<br>**Past** `Perfect`<br>**Past** `Continuous`|

<br>

### `Present` time clause
- `When` she **comes** to scholl she **takes off** her coat.
- Please **turn off** the light `when` you **leave** the room.
- **Don't forget** to pay for your dinner `before` you **leave** the canteen.

<br>

### `Future` time clause

- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **had grounded** her.
- She **stayed** in her room for two days `before` she finally **emerged**.

<br>

The **Past** `Perfect` is **not** required in **time** clause connected by `before` or `after`:
- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **had grounded** her.  (**Past** `Perfect`)
- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **grounded** her.      (**Past** `Simple`)

- She **stayed** in her room for two days `before` she finally **emerged**.        (**Past** `Simple`)

<br>

### Time clauses with `since`
When a **time** clause begins with `since`, the verb can be in either the **Present** `Perfect` or the **Past** `Simple` tense.<br>

- When the **time** clause action **ended** *in the past*, use **Past** `Simple`:
  - Nick **hasn’t spoken** to Ann `since` he **grounded** her last week.
- When the **time** clause action **began** *in the past* but **continues** *into the future*, use **Present** `Perfect`:
  - She **hasn’t spoken** to her friends `since` she **has been grounded**.
