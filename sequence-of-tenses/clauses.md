# Clause
A **clause** is a group of words which contains a **subject** and a **predicate** (**verb**) and expresses a complete thought. In other words, a **clause** is a **sentence** or a **part of a sentence** that has meaning **on its own**.<br>

There are **2** main types of clauses:
- **main** clause (aka **independent** clauses);
- **subordinate** clause (aka **dependent** clauses);

<br>

# Main clause
An **independent** clause **can** *stand alone* as a **sentence**.<br>

### Examples
- She ran to catch the bus.
- He sings in the shower.
- The sun is shining brightly.
- They are going on vacation next week.
- I am learning to play the guitar.

<br>

# Subordinate clause
A **dependent** clause **cannot** *stand alone* as a **sentence** and is dependent on an **independent** clause (aka **main** clause) to make sense.<br>

### Examples
- Because I was tired, I went to bed early.
- When she arrived at the party, everyone cheered.
- If it rains tomorrow, we will stay inside.
- Although he tried his best, he still failed the exam.
- Since I don't have a car, I take the bus to work.

<br>

Kinds of **subordinate** clauses:
- **relative** clauses;
- **time** clauses;

<br>

## Relative clause
A **relative** clause is a **kind** of **dependent** clause which **provides additional information** about a **noun** or **pronoun** in your **main** clause.<br>
Relative clauses are introduced by relative pronouns such as `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which` and `that`.<br>

### Examples
- The man, **who lives in that house**, is a doctor.
- The book, **which I read last week**, was very interesting.
- The house, **whose roof was damaged**, is being repaired.
- The car, **that I bought last year**, broke down.
- The cake, **which my mom baked**, tasted delicious.

<br>

## Time clause
A **time** clause is a **dependent** clause that begins with a **time word**:
- `after`;
- `as long as`;
- `as soon as`;
- `as`;
- `before`;
- `by the time`;
- `hardly ... when ...`;
- `if`;
- `just as`;
- `once`;
- `since`;
- `till`;
- `untill`;
- `when`;
- `while`;

<br>

# Sequence of tenses
## General rules
There are **2 genereal rules**:
1. If **main** clause uses **Present** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then **any** appropriate *tense* can be used in **subordinate** clause.
  - `When` she **comes** to scholl she **takes off** her coat.
  - Please **turn off** the light `when` you **leave** the room.
2. If **main** clause uses **Future** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then **any** appropriate *tense* can be used in **subordinate** clause.
3. If **main** clause uses **Past** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) then one of **Past** *tense* must be used.
  - **There 3 situations**:
    - action in **main** clause and action in **subordinate** clause are happening **simultaneously**:
      - They **told** us they **were going** to the library.
    - action in **main** clause happened **before** action in **subordinate** clause:
      - I **was sure** that Maria **had been hiding** the truth from all of us for a very long time.
    - action in **subordinate** clause will happen **after** action in **main** clause:
      - I kinda **knew** that you **would come** to me tonight!
      - You **said** you **would help** me with my French homework.

<br>

**Exceptions**:
- When we talk about facts:
  - Newton **proved** that bodies **attract** each other.
- **But** if **main** clause uses **Future** (`Simple`/`Continuous`/`Perfect`/`Perfect continuous`) and **subordinate** **clause** is `Time` **clause**, i.e. starts with `if`/`when`/`till`/.., then **Present** `Simple` only must be used:
  - `If` the weather **is fine** tomorrow, we **will go** to the country.
  - `When` she **comes** to scholl she **will take off** her coat.
  - `When` you **cross** the park, you **will** see the hospital.
- **But** if `When` is a **question word**, then **sequnces of times rules** are **not** enforced:
  - Could you tell me **when the bus will come**?

<br>

## `Present` time clause
- `When` she **comes** to scholl she **takes off** her coat.
- Please **turn off** the light `when` you **leave** the room.
- **Don't forget** to pay for your dinner `before` you **leave** the canteen.

<br>

## `Future` time clause
- `If` the weather **is fine** tomorrow, we **will go** to the country.
- `When` she **comes** to scholl she **will take off** her coat.
- `When` you **cross** the park, you **will** see the hospital.
- She **will** wait for him `till` he **comes** back.
- I **will** call you `as soon as` I **get** home from the hospital.
- I **will** go to university `after` I **leave** school.
- I **will** stay at home `till` she **comes**. Then we **will** go to the theatre `if` she **brings** tickets.
- Where **will** you go `when` you **come** to London?
- `If` I see I **will** tell him about their letter.
- The meeting **will** begin `as soon as` everyone **arrives**.     (**Present** `Simple`)
- The meeting **will** begin `as soon as` everyone **has arrived**. (**Present** `Perfect`)
- We **will** go out for dinner `after` the meeting **is** over.
- I **am going to** review the file `before` I **meet** with the new client.

<br>

## `Past` time clause
- I **tidied** my room `after` I **had cooked** dinner.
- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **had grounded** her.
- She **stayed** in her room for two days `before` she finally **emerged**.

<br>

The **Past** `Perfect` is **not** required in **time** clause connected by `before` or `after`:
- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **had grounded** her.  (**Past** `Perfect`)
- Rick’s daughter **locked** herself in her room `after` he **grounded** her.      (**Past** `Simple`)
- She **had stayed** in her room for two days `before` she finally **emerged**.    (**Past** `Perfect`)
- She **stayed** in her room for two days `before` she finally **emerged**.        (**Past** `Simple`)

<br>

## Time clauses with `since`
When a **time** clause begins with `since`, the verb can be in either the **Present** `Perfect` or the **Past** `Simple` tense.<br>

- When the **time** clause action **ended** *in the past*, use **Past** `Simple`:
  - Nick **hasn’t spoken** to Ann `since` he **grounded** her last week.
- When the **time** clause action **began** *in the past* but **continues** *into the future*, use **Present** `Perfect`:
  - She **hasn’t spoken** to her friends `since` she **has been grounded**.
