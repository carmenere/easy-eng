1. **Adverbs** form their **comparative** and **superlative** the same way as adjectives.
   - hard → hard`er` → hard`est`;
   - earl**y** → earl**i**`er` → earl**i**`est`
2. The adverbs which are formed by adding `ly` to the adjectives take `more` int he **comparative** and `most` in the **superlative**:
   - careful`ly` → `more` careful`ly` → `most` careful`ly`
   - eas`ily` → more eas`ily` → most eas`ily`
